# DigiSpark Attiny85 poor man's RubberDucky
For people who can't buy or are too cheap to buy RubberDucky, DigiSpark Attiny85 is the solution to their problems. Because it's possible to use it as HID thanks to "DigiKeyboard.h" it can be use as keyboard to send keystrokes to computer / Mobile Phones which can be use for pranking your people to creating a backdoor in target system.

## What's here?
I have created this repo for sharing my payloads for DigiSpark Attiny85. It's my first time programming any device and so far no fires. All the payloads are tested on Attiny85 and created on Arduino IDE.

## Getting Started
For people like me who are new to this i would suggest visiting [Maker.pro](https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/how-to-build-a-rubber-ducky-usb-with-arduino-using-a-digispark-module) for instruction on setting up development environment for Attiny85.
