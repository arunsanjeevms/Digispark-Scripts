 **# DigiSpark Attiny85 poor man's RubberDucky** 🦆

For people who can't buy or are too cheap to buy RubberDucky, DigiSpark Attiny85 is the solution to their problems. Because it's possible to use it as HID thanks to "DigiKeyboard.h" it can be used as a keyboard to send keystrokes to computers / Mobile Phones, which can be used for pranking your people to creating a backdoor in the target system.

## What's here? 🤔
I have created this repo for sharing my payloads for DigiSpark Attiny85. It's my first time programming any device and so far no fires. All the payloads are tested on Attiny85 and created on Arduino IDE.

## Getting Started 🛠️
For people like me who are new to this, I would suggest visiting [Maker.pro](https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/how-to-build-a-rubber-ducky-usb-with-arduino-using-a-digispark-module) for instructions on setting up the development environment for Attiny85.
